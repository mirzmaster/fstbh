Overview

A Firefox add-on that allows auto-hiding of toolbars. Makes toolbars float over the webpage content when showing so that the content is not moved. This changes the default Firefox fullscreen auto-hide behavior.

The basics

The functionality centers around changing #browser-panel between its normal display mode and -moz-stack in order to enable the autohide capability. As a result, several workarounds and careful considerations are used in order to interoperate with the numerous Firefox add-ons that modify the toolbars and titlebar (especially under Windows).
